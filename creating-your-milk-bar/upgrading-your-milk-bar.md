# Upgrading Your Milk Bar

There are three types of Upgrades: Contacts, Personnel, and Facilities.&#x20;

## Facilities

Rather than classes, powering up new Facilities in your Milk Bar allows your Communard to use new, specialised equipment.&#x20;

### Kitchen

_Prerequisite:_ Chef

Every time you use a Ration, roll a d6. On a 6, the Ration isn't depleted.&#x20;

### Armoury

### Infirmary

Once per expedition, you may roll an extra d6 during a Short Rest.&#x20;

### Dormitory

### Generator

### Cell Tower

### Laboratory

### Graygate

### Teleportation Gate

## Personnel

### Chef

_Overseer of the Milk Bar. Takes a cool head to keep the Kitchen going._&#x20;
