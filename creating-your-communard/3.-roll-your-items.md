# 3. Roll Your Items

### Inventory

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack with six slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head). The backpack can also double as an emergency sleeping bag but only if emptied of its contents.

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Warden's discretion.

Bulky items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 Health.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts, animals, and vehicles can increase inventory. Communards can also be paid to carry equipment.

#### **Starting Gear**

All Communards begin with:

* Three days' rations (one slot)
* A torch (one slot)
* 1d4 batteries&#x20;

As well as:

* Two items from their background
* A weapon of your choice from the [Starting Weapons](../reference/starting-weapons.md) table
