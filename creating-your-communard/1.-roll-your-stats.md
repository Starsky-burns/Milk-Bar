# 1. Roll Your Stats

Your character has four core attributes. These represent their strengths and weaknesses.&#x20;

* **Strength (STR)**: Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.&#x20;
* **Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.&#x20;
* **Willpower (WIL)**: Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, etc.
* **Tech (TECH)**: Used for saves requiring interfacing with technology like rigging, engineering, hacking, etc.

Roll 3d6 for each attribute. You can swap any two of the attributes.

### Health and Wounds

Roll 1d10+10 to determine your character's starting **Health**, which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. Every character starts with 2 **Wounds**.

Every time your **Health** hits 0, mark 1 **Wound** on your Character Sheet, then roll on the [Wound Table](../reference/wound-table.md).
