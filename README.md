# What is this?

Milk Bar is a sci-fi OSR game about Communards in a post-Soviet Poland building a new community and delving into the ruins of Soviet bases for future-tech.&#x20;

My aim is to create a game suitable for neat, near-future sci-fi  one-shots, as well as the tools to support campaign play.&#x20;

This is a _very_ basic WIP for now. I'm collecting all the ideas and mechanics I like from several games with the aim of whittling them down into something coherent and a game I'd love to play myself.&#x20;

Inspirations include:

* Mausritter
* Into The Odd
* Old School Essentials
* The Electrum Archive
* Mothership
* Vaults of Vaarn
* Cairn
* Vaesen
* Simon Stålenhag
* Miś
* Seksmisja
* Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto
* Tom Clancy's The Division (don't ask)
