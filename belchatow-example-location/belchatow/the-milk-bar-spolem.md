# The Milk Bar „Społem”

This community-run kitchen is the home of everyone who remains in Belchatow after the blast. Its wide canteen is flanked by an internal window which opens out to a kitchen operated almost 24/7. Pickiness discouraged, the hungry pick up whichever food is hottest and available, and the large vats supply a constant stream of stews and broths.&#x20;
